This is an updated example of a C# Hello World example with Amazon SWF.

Some Credit needs to go to https://github.com/padisetty. His (I use that term because when I googled his name that was the first image that appeared) blog was super helpful in linking some of the concepts between amazon's ruby swf example and the c# implementation of it. I highly recommend reading it.
